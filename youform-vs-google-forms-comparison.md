# Youform vs Google Forms

_A modern Google Forms alternative for branded, high-converting forms_

---

## Overview

Google Forms is built for simple data collection inside the Google ecosystem. Youform, on the other hand, is built for teams, creators, businesses and individuals who want forms that look professional, offer stronger user experience, total branding control, and far fewer limitations.

Below, we formally outline where Youform goes further – and why more and more businesses, founders and teams are choosing it as their Google Forms alternative.
