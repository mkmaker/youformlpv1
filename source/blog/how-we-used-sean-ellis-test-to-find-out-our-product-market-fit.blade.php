According to Sean Ellis test, you ask your users the following question:&nbsp;</p><p>"<em>How would you feel if you could no longer use the product?</em>" and give them three options:&nbsp;<br>- very disappointed, <br>- somewhat disappointed <br>- not disappointed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>The findings of the test says that if at least 40% of your users respond with "very disappointed", then it's a strong signal for product market fit.&nbsp;</p><p><span style="background-color: inherit;">Hence we used this test and obviously used <a target="_blank" href="https://youform.com/" alt="Youform" rel="noopener">Youform</a> to create the survey.&nbsp;</span></p><p>We added it on our dashboard and only showed it to the repeated users. We kept it for a week and after a week, almost 105 users responded to the survey.&nbsp;</p><p>Our finding was that 64% of the responders said that they will be very disappointed. So if we go by Sean Ellis test, Youform has passed the product market fit survey.&nbsp;</p><div class="my-6"><img class="rounded-lg border border-gray-200 w-full" src="https://assets.superblog.ai/site_cuid_clti911u70009j6wijndw66kq/images/exportedimage-3-1739513660569-compressed.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></div><p><span style="background-color: inherit;">Do you want to conduct this survey for your product?
