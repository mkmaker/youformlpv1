                            Hey, this is Davis Baer writing this, the co-founder of Youform. I‚Äôm going to write this in the first person because I think it‚Äôs weird when people write their About page in third person.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            We created Youform in 2023 with the intention of giving people a Typeform alternative that was fairly priced - but still had a great UI and UX.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            I lead Youform along with my co-founder Abhishek Chakravarty.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            I live in the USA (in Pennsylvania), while Abhishek lives in India (in Bangalore).
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            Both Abhishek and I have started successful software companies in the past:
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            I co-founded and grew <a href="https://www.oneupapp.io/" class="text-blue-700">OneUp</a> (a social media scheduling tool) to millions of dollars in revenue.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            Abhishek has built and sold Botflow, a chatbot builder, amongst a handful of other successful products he‚Äôs created.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            All form data is securely stored with AWS servers in the USA. The official company name is ‚ÄúYouform‚Äù, and the business is registered in India.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            Financially, we are 100% bootstrapped and PROFITABLE, with many paying customers that easily cover our expenses. And we also have nearly infinite runway from the success of our past companies.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-2">
                            I‚Äôm not saying this to brag, but rather to give you the confidence that Youform WILL be around for years and years to come.
                        </p>
